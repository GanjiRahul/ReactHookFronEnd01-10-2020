      value:`React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, 
              and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.Declarative 
              views make your code more predictable and easier to debug. Build encapsulated components that manage their
              own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of 
              templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.`

    { key:'NodeJs',
      value:`Node.js is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like Ruby's Event Machine and Python's Twisted. 
             Node.js takes the event model a bit further. It presents an event loop as a runtime construct instead of as 
             a library. In other systems, there is always a blocking call to start the event-loop. Typically, behavior is 
             defined through callbacks at the beginning of a script, and at the end a server is started through a blocking 
             call like EventMachine::run(). In Node.js, there is no such start-the-event-loop call. Node.js simply enters 
             the event loop after executing the input script.`

               easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly 
               capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting
